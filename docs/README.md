# North Polar Project

## Project Description

The North Polar Project aims to design an efficient coverage algorithm for urban areas in the Arctic region, minimizing geographic scope to target densely built-up zones while avoiding the collection of irrelevant data (such as forests and rivers). The project leverages the powerful geospatial analysis capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the interactive development environment of Google Colab.

## Project Background
- Geographic Scope: The project covers the entire Arctic region, including countries such as Finland, Iceland, Russia, and Canada.
- Challenge: Acquiring high-resolution geospatial data directly is costly and often includes large amounts of data unrelated to buildings.
- Objective: Develop an algorithm to cover all essential urban (building-dense) areas with minimal geographic footprint.

## Technical Requirements
- Geospatial processing based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform.
- Code development and execution using Google Colab.
